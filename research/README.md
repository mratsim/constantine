# Research

This folder stashes experimentations before they are productionized into the library.

- `codegen`: LLVM IR codegen to produce optimal assembly `.asm`
- `constraint_systems`: Research into how constraint systems like R1CS, UltraPlonk or CCS can reuse research from Deep Learning Compiler, Polyhedral compilers, integer programming and constraint programming.
- `endomorphisms`: Scalar multiplication with endomorphism acceleration\
  - Faster Point Multiplication on Elliptic Curves with Efficient Endomorphisms\
    Robert P. Gallant, Robert J. Lambert, and Scott A. Vanstone
