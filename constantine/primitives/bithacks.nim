# Bithacks
# ------------------------------------------------------------
# TODO: Nim std/bitops is unsatisfactory
#       in particular the "noUndefined" flag
#       for countLeadingZeroBits/countTrailingZeroBits
#       is returning zero instead of the integer bitwidth
#
#       Furthermore it is not guaranteed constant-time
#       And lastly, even compiler builtin may be slightly inefficient
#       for example when doing fastLog2
#       which is "31 - builtin_clz" we get
#       `bsr + xor (from clz) + sub`
#       instead of plain `bsr`
#
#       At the moment we don't need them to operate on secret data
#
