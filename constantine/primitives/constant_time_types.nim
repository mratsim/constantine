  BaseUint* = SomeUnsignedInt or byte

  Ct*[T: BaseUint] = distinct T

  CTBool*[T: Ct] = distinct T # range[T(0)..T(1)]
    ## To avoid the compiler replacing bitwise boolean operations
    ## by conditional branches, we don't use booleans.
    ## We use an int to prevent compiler "optimization" and introduction of branches
    # Note, we could use "range" but then the codegen
    # uses machine-sized signed integer types.
    # signed types and machine-dependent words are undesired
    # - we don't want compiler optimizing signed "undefined behavior"
    # - Basic functions like BigInt add/sub
    #   return and/or accept CTBool, we don't want them
    #   to require unnecessarily 8 bytes instead of 4 bytes
