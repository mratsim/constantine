#
#             Field arithmetic with saturated limbs
#
# ############################################################
#
# This implements field operations in pure LLVM
# using saturated limbs, i.e. 64-bit words on 64-bit platforms.
#
# This relies on hardware addition-with-carry and substraction-with-borrow
# for efficiency.
#
# As such it is not suitable for platforms with no carry flags such as:
# - WASM
# - MIPS
# - RISC-V
# - Metal
#
# It may be suitable for Intel GPUs as the virtual ISA does support add-carry
#
# It is (theoretically) suitable for:
# - ARM
# - AMD GPUs
#
# The following backends have better optimizations through assembly:
# - x86: access to ADOX and ADCX interleaved double-carry chain
# - Nvidia: access to multiply accumulate instruction
#           and non-interleaved double-carry chain
#
# Hardware limitations
# --------------------
#
# AMD GPUs may benefits from using 24-bit limbs
# - https://www.amd.com/content/dam/amd/en/documents/radeon-tech-docs/programmer-references/AMD_OpenCL_Programming_Optimization_Guide2.pdf
#   p2-23:
#  Generally, the throughput and latency for 32-bit integer operations is the same
#  as for single-precision floating point operations.
#  24-bit integer MULs and MADs have four times the throughput of 32-bit integer
#  multiplies. 24-bit signed and unsigned integers are natively supported on the
#  GCN family of devices. The use of OpenCL built-in functions for mul24 and mad24
#  is encouraged. Note that mul24 can be useful for array indexing operations
#  Doc from 2015, it might not apply to RDNA family

#   "Since Turing, Nvidia also achieves very good integer multiplication performance.
#    Integer multiplication appears to be extremely rare in shader code,
#    and AMD doesn’t seem to have optimized for it.
#    32-bit integer multiplication executes at around a quarter of FP32 rate,
#    and latency is pretty high too."
#
# Software limitations
# --------------------
#
# Unfortunately implementing unrolled using word size is fraught with perils
# for add-carry / sub-borrow
# AMDGPU crash: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/102058
# ARM64 missed optim: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/102062
#
# and while using @llvm.usub.with.overflow.i64 allows ARM64 to solve the missing optimization
# it is also missed on AMDGPU (or nvidia)
#
# And implementing them with i256 / i384 is similarly tricky
# https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/issues/102868
