  BigInt*[bits: static int] = object
    ## Fixed-precision big integer
    ##
    ## - "bits" is the announced bit-length of the BigInt
    ##   This is public data, usually equal to the curve prime bitlength.
    ##
    ## - "limbs" is an internal field that holds the internal representation
    ##   of the big integer. Least-significant limb first. Within limbs words are native-endian.
    ##
    ## This internal representation can be changed
    ## without notice and should not be used by external applications or libraries.
