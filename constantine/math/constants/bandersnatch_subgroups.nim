  # Bandersnatch Subgroup

  # The group structure of bandersnatch is ℤ₂ x ℤ₂ x p, where p is a prime
  #
  # The non-cyclic subgroup which we may refer to as the 2 torsion subgroup is:
  #   E[2] = {(0, 1), D₀, D₁, D₂}
  #
  # Remark: All of these points have order 2 or 1, so it is sufficient to double any point in the bandersnatch group to clear the cofactor. ie one does not need to multiply by the cofactor; 4.
  # Remark: We may also refer to the 2 torsion subgroup as the small order subgroup.
