# ############################################################

# Curves & their corresponding finite fields are preconfigured in this file

# Note, in the past the convention was to name a curve by its conjectured security level.
# as this might change with advances in research, the new convention is
# to name curves according to the length of the prime bit length.
# i.e. the BN254 was previously named BN128.

# Curves security level were significantly impacted by
# advances in the Tower Number Field Sieve.
# in particular BN254 curve security dropped
# from estimated 128-bit to estimated 100-bit
