  ## When using LTO with AT&T syntax
  ## - GCC will give spurious "Warning: missing operand; zero assumed" with AT&T syntax
  ## - Clang will wrongly combine memory offset and constant propagated address of constants
  ##
  ## Intel syntax does not have such limitation.
  ## However
  ## - Global "-masm=intel" composition with other libraries that use AT&T inline assembly
  ## - It is not supported on Apple Clang due to missing
  ##   commit: https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/commit/ae98182cf7341181e4aa815c372a072dec82779f
  ##   Revision: https://reviews.llvm.org/D113707
  ##
  ## As a workaround:
  ## - Intel assembly is used on a per-file basis
  ##   and does not affect other libraries that might be compiled together with Constantine.
  ## - It is deactivated on MacOs / iOS.
  ##   That means LTO will not work on MacOS unless upstream Clang is used instead of Apple fork.
