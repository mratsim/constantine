# Tasks have an efficient design so that a single heap allocation
# is required per `spawn`.
# This greatly reduce overhead and potential memory fragmentation for long-running applications.
#
# This is done by tasks:
# - being an intrusive linked lists
# - integrating the channel to send results
#
# Flowvar is the public type created when spawning a task.
# and can be synced to receive the task result.
# Flowvars are also called future interchangeably.
# (The name future is already used for IO scheduling)
