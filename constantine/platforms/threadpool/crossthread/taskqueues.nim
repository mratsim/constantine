# The task queue implements the following push, pop, steal, stealHalf
#
#    front                                              back
#                 ---------------------------------
#  steal()     <- |         |          |          | <- push()
#  stealHalf() <- | Task 0  |  Task 1  |  Task 2  | -> pop()
#  any thread     |         |          |          |    owner-only
#                 ---------------------------------
#
# To reduce contention, stealing is done on the opposite end from push/pop
# so that there is a race only for the very last task(s).

{.push raises: [], checks: off.} # No exceptions in a multithreading datastructure
