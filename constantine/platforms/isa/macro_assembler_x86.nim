when UseAsmSyntaxIntel:
  # We need Intel syntax.
  # When using memory operand with displacement the default AT&T syntax is
  # 8(%[identifier])
  # GCC accepts 8+(%[identifier]) as well but not Clang
  # However when constant are propagated, 8(%[identifier]) can also expand to
  # 8BLS12_381_Modulus(%rip) i.e. the compiler tries to forward to the linker the relative address of a constant
  # and due to naive string mixin it fails.
