# Tasks have an efficient design so that a single heap allocation
# is required per `spawn`.
# This greatly reduce overhead and potential memory fragmentation for long-running applications.
#
# This is done by tasks:
# - being an intrusive linked lists
# - integrating the channel to send results
#
# Flowvar is the public type created when spawning a task.
# and can be synced to receive the task result.
# Flowvars are also called future interchangeably.
# (The name future is already used for IO scheduling)

# Task State
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Tasks have the following lifecycle:
# - A task creator that schedule a task on its queue
# - A task runner, task creator or thief, that runs the task
# - Once the task is finished:
#   - if the task has no future, the task runner frees the task
#   - if the task has a future,
#     - the task runner can immediately pick up new work
#     - the awaiting thread frees the task
#     - the awaiting thread might be sleeping and need to be woken up.
#
# There is a delicate dance as we are need to prevent 2 issues:
#
# 1. A deadlock:        if the waiter is never woken up after the thief completes the task
# 2. A use-after-free:  if the thief tries to access the task after the waiter frees it.
#
# To solve 1, we need to set a `completed` flag, then check again if the waiter parked before.
# To solve 2, we either need to ensure that after the `completed` flag is set, the task runner
#             doesn't access the task anymore which is impossible due to 1;
#             or we have the waiter spinlock on another flag `canBeFreed`.
