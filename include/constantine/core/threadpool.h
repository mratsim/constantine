 *
 * A threadpool uses thread-local storage and (for external consumers)
 * MUST be used from the thread that instantiated it.
 *
 * In particular, this means that:
 * - runtime.LockOSThread() is needed from Go to avoid it allocating CGO calls to a new thread.
 * - The threadpool cannot be ``Send`` in Rust or ``Clone`` (we can't deep-copy threads)
 *
 * 2 threadpools MUST NOT be instantiated at the same time from the same thread.
 *
 * Mixing with other libraries' threadpools and runtime
 * will not impact correctness but may impact performance.
