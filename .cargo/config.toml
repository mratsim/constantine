# Uncomment the rustflags for cross Nim-Rust LTO
# Use "CTT_LTO=1 cargo build" to force LTO on the Nim side
#
# Notes:
#  Even without full-LTO, Constantine does partial LTO within the Nim library.
#
#  On MacOS, for Intel targets, LTO and partial LTO are not used
#  as Apple Clang does not support the Intel assembly syntax.
#  Unfortunately the combination Clang + AT&T syntax causes issues
#  when LTO propagates constants into inline assembly.
