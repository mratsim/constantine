# Optimizations

This document lists the optimizations relevant to an elliptic curve or pairing-based cryptography library and whether Constantine has them implemented.

The optimizations can be of algebraic, algorithmic or "implementation details" nature. Using non-constant time code is always possible, it is listed if the speedup is significant.
