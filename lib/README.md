# Libraries

This folder holds the generated dynamic libraries (.so on Linux,  .dylib on MacOS, .dll on Windows) and static libraries (.a on Linux and Mac, .dll on Windows).

To create a new build, download install the [Nim programming language](https://nim-lang.org/install.html), navigate to Constantine's root folder and call `nimble bindings`.
