# When Constantine is built as a library, we want to minimize friction of using it. 
# Hence we want to users to be able to directly use it without special ceremony.
#
# This is possible for dynamic libraries if --noMain isn't used.

# 
# The function DllMain is autoloaded on Windows
# Functions tagged __attribute__((constructor)) are autoloaded on UNIX OSes
#
# Alas, Nim doesn't provide such facilities for static libraries
# so we provide our own {.loadTime.} macro for autoloading:
# - any proc
# - on any OS
# - whether using a dynamic or static library
#
# We use them for runtime CPU features detection.
#
# And on Windows as functions in DLLs (kernel APIs for the threadpool for example) are loaded
# as global variables
