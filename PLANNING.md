# Constantine's planning

This document is current as of June 23, 2024.

This splits Constantine's axis of development under various tracks.
Priority is given to Ethereum, proof systems and optimization tracks.

Other tracks are stretch goals, contributions towards them are accepted.

    - erasure codes: https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/29d3a24/specs/_features/eip7594/das-core.md#recover_matrix
  - executive summary: 2-dimensional data availability sampling for KZG polynomial commitments
  - Prerequisites:
    - Coset FFT
    - KZG multiproofs
    - Polynomial interpolation
- Fuzzing
    - BLS signatures
    - KZG in https://github.com/jtraglia/kzg-fuzz

    - Secret Shared Leader Election
    - Single Slot Finality
    - enshrined DVT (distributed validator technology)

### Ethereum Execution Track

- Keccak
  - with hardware acceleration
- Hash functions precompiles:
  - RIPEMD-160, Blake2
- KZG point precompile
- Verkle Tries
  - Finish IPA for Verkle Tries:
    - Full test suite coverage https://github.com/mratsim/constantine/issues/396
    - Fix multiproofs
    - Add IPA and multiproofs to benchmark to compare with other implementations

- Fast MSM for fixed base like Trusted Setups and Ethreum Verkle Tries
  - Notes on MSMs with precomputation https://hackmd.io/WfIjm0icSmSoqy2cfqenhQ
  - Verkle Trees - Another iteration of VKTs MSMs https://hackmd.io/@jsign/vkt-another-iteration-of-vkt-msms

### Proving Ethereum track

- Proof-of-equivalence for Ethereum KZG:
  - https://notes.ethereum.org/@vbuterin/proto_danksharding_faq#Moderate-approach-works-with-any-ZK-SNARK
  - https://notes.ethereum.org/@dankrad/kzg_commitments_in_proofs
  - https://ethresear.ch/t/easy-proof-of-equivalence-between-multiple-polynomial-commitment-schemes-to-the-same-data/8188

  - Prerequisites:
    - ZK friendly hash function like Poseidon (there are 2 versions !): https://github.com/mratsim/constantine/issues/294

- Groth16 + on-chain verifier code-generator (solidity/huff/yul)

- Long-term project, unspecified:
    - Snarkified EVM

### Optimization track

- ARM assembly
- Finish Nvidia GPU codegenerator up to MSM
- Implement a backend for Solinas prime like P256
- Implement an unsaturated finite fields backend for Risc-V, WASM, WebGPU, AMD GPU, Apple Metal, Vulkan, ...
    - ideally in LLVM IR so that pristine Risc-V assembly can be generated
      and used in zkVMs without any risk of C stdlib or syscalls being used
      and without depending on the Nim compiler at build time.
- introduce batchAffine_vartime
- Optimized square_repeated in assembly for Montgomery and Crandall/Pseudo-Mersenne primes
- Optimized elliptic curve directly calling assembly without ADX checks and limited input/output movement in registers or using function multi-versioning.
- LLVM IR:
  - use internal or private linkage type
  - look into calling conventions like "fast" or "Tail fast"
  - check if returning a value from function is propely optimized
    compared to in-place result
  - use readnone (pure) and readmem attribute for functions
  - look into passing parameter as arrays instead of pointers?
  - use hot function attribute

### User Experience track

Create a "Constantine book" to introduce Constantine concepts and walkthrough available protocols.

### Technical marketing track

- Create Python bindings
    - provide primitives appealing to cryptography researchers and enabling fast prototyping

- Create a Constantine benchmark CLI and UI.
  - Make it easy-to-use from tools like Phoronix test suite
  - Give a single-threaded/multi-threaded, for use in say EthDocker to rank hardware.
  - Integrate building it in CI
  - Goal: the reference cryptographic benchmark

- Participate in secp256k1 programming language benchmark:
  - https://programming-language-benchmarks.vercel.app/problem/secp256k1
  - outline: https://github.com/mratsim/constantine/issues/285
